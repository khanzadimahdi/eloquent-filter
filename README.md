### A simple implementation without Eloquent Filter
The Request URI could look like this:
                                                                                     
    http://localhost:8000/users/index?age_more_than=25&gender=male&created_at=25-09-2019
 
And a simple implementation in the Controller would look like this: 
 
```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\User;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class UserController extends Controller
{
    public function index(Request $request)
    {
        $users = User::where('is_active', true);

        if ($request->has('age_more_than')) {
            $users->where('age', '>', $request->age_more_than);
        }

        if ($request->has('gender')) {
            $users->where('gender', $request->gender);
        }

        if ($request->has('created_at')) {
            $users->where('created_at','>=', $request->created_at);
        }

        return $users->get();
    }
}
```
This solution is simple and would work fine.
But you'd have to add a condition for each filter you need. 
Especially with more complex filtering your code can become a Monster very fast! :boom: 


### A simple implementation with Eloquent Filter

Eloquent Filter can help you to fix that problem. Just you will set query string to work with that.
It will save you time and minimize the complexity of your code.

After installing Eloquent Filter the request URI could look like this:
             
    http://localhost:8000/users/list?age_more_than[operator]=>&age[value]=35&gender=male&created_at[operator]==>&created_at[value]=25-09-2019


And in the controller you'd just need that one line: 
```php
/**
 * Class UsersController.
 */

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\User;

class UsersController
{
    public function list()
    {
        return User::filter()->get();
    }
}
```
With this Eloquent filter implementation you can use all the documented filters!

## :electric_plug: Installation

1- Run this Composer command to install the latest version

      $ composer require mehdi-fathi/eloquent-filter
      
- **Note**  for Laravel versions older than 5.8 you should install version 2.2.5 

        $ composer require mehdi-fathi/eloquent-filter:2.2.5

2- Add `eloquentFilter\ServiceProvider::class` to provider app.php
   
   ```php
   'providers' => [
     /*
      * Package Service Providers...
      */
       eloquentFilter\ServiceProvider::class
   ],
   ```
3- Add Facade `'EloquentFilter' => eloquentFilter\Facade\EloquentFilter::class` to aliases app.php

```php
'alias' => [
  /*
   * Facade alias...
   */
    'EloquentFilter' => eloquentFilter\Facade\EloquentFilter::class,
],
```
That's it enjoy! :boom:
## :book: Basic Usage

### Config Model and set whitelist

Add Filterable trait to your models and set fields that you will want filter in whitelist. You can override this method in your models.

```php
use eloquentFilter\QueryFilter\ModelFilters\Filterable;

class User extends Model
{
    use Filterable;
    
    private static $whiteListFilter =[
        'id',
        'username',
        'email',
        'created_at',
        'updated_at',
    ];
}
```
You can set `*` char for filter in all fields as like below example:
 
```php
private static $whiteListFilter = ['*'];
```
You can add or set `$whiteListFilter` on the fly in your method.For example:

***Set array to WhiteListFilter***

- **Note** that this method override `$whiteListFilter`
```php
User::setWhiteListFilter(['name']); 
```
***Add new field to WhiteListFilter***
```php
User::addWhiteListFilter('name'); 
```

### Use in Controller

Change your code on controller of laravel as like below example:

```php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

/**
 * Class UsersController.
 */
class UsersController
{

    public function list()
    {
          if (!empty(request()->get('username'))) {
          
              $users = User::ignoreRequest('perpage')->filter()->with('posts')
                        ->orderByDesc('id')->paginate(request()->get('perpage'),['*'],'page');

          } else {
              $users = User::filter(
                ['username' => ['mehdi','ali']]           
                )->with('posts')->orderByDesc('id')->paginate(10,['*'],'page');
          }
    }
}
```
-**Note**  that the Eloquent Filter by default using the query string to make queries in the laravel.
 Also, you can set the array to `filter` method Model for making your own custom condition without query string.

-**Note**  that you must unset your own param as perpage. Just you can set page param for paginate this param ignore from filter.

- You can ignore some request params by use of code it.

```php

User::ignoreRequest(['perpage'])
            ->filter()
            ->paginate(request()->get('perpage'), ['*'], 'page');
```

Call `ignoreRequest` will ignore some requests that you don't want to use in conditions eloquent filter. 
For example perpage param will never be in the conditions eloquent filter. 
it's related to the paginate method. `page` param ignore by default in the Eloquent Filter Laravel.

- You can filter some request params for using in eloquent filter.

```php

User::AcceptRequest(['username','id'])
            ->filter()
            ->paginate(request()->get('perpage'), ['*'], 'page');
```

Call `AcceptRequest` will accept requests that you want to use in conditions eloquent filter. 
For example `username` and `id` param will be in the conditions eloquent filter. Just notice you must set `$whiteListFilter`
in Model. This method is useful for query string manipulation by user.


- Another example use of a filter eloquent filter.
```php
User::filter()->paginate();
```
- `EloquentFilter::filterRequests()` get all params that used by the Eloquent Filter. You can set key to get specific index.
For example `EloquentFilter::filterRequests('username')` it's getting username index.

- `EloquentFilter::getAcceptedRequest()` get all params that set by the AcceptRequest method.

- `EloquentFilter::getIgnoredRequest()` get all ignored params that set by the getIgnoreRequest method.

### Simple Examples

You just pass data blade form to query string or generate query string in controller method. For example:

**Simple Where**
```
/users/list?email=mehdifathi.developer@gmail.com

SELECT ... WHERE ... email = 'mehdifathi.developer@gmail.com'
```

```
/users/list?first_name=mehdi&last_name=fathi

SELECT ... WHERE ... first_name = 'mehdi' AND last_name = 'fathi'
```

***Where In***

This example make method `whereIn`.

```
/users/list?username[]=ali&username[]=ali22&family=ahmadi

SELECT ... WHERE ... username in ('ali','ali22') AND family = 'ahmadi'
```

***OrWhere (New feature :fire:)***

This example make method `orWhere`.

```
/users/list?name=mehdi&username=fathi&or[username]=ali

SELECT ... WHERE ... name = 'mehdi' AND username = 'fathi' or username = 'ali'
```

***Where like***

If you are going to make query by like conditions. You can do it that by this example.

```
/users/list?first_name[like]=%John%

SELECT ... WHERE ... first_name LIKE '%John%'

```

***Where by operator***

You can set any operator mysql in query string.

```
/users/list?count_posts[operator]=>&count_posts[value]=35

SELECT ... WHERE ... count_posts > 35
```
```
/users/list?username[operator]=!=&username[value]=ali

SELECT ... WHERE ... username != 'ali'
```
```
/users/list?count_posts[operator]=<&count_posts[value]=25

SELECT ... WHERE ... count_posts < 25
```

**Where the nested relation Model (New feature :fire:)**


You can set all nested relation in the query string just by the array query string. For example, the user model has a relation with posts.
and posts table has a relation with orders. You can make query conditions by set 'posts[count_post]' and 'posts[orders][name]' in the query string.
Just be careful you must set 'posts.count_post' and 'posts.orders.name' in the User model.

```php
use eloquentFilter\QueryFilter\ModelFilters\Filterable;

class User extends Model
{
    use Filterable;
   
    private static $whiteListFilter =[
        'username',
        'posts.count_post',
        'posts.category',
        'posts.orders.name',
    ];

    /**
     * @return \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\belongsTo
     */
    public function posts()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo('Models\Post');
    }

}
``` 

```
/users/list?posts[count_post]=876&username=mehdi

select * from "users" where exists 
         (select * from "posts" where "posts"."user_id" = "users"."id" 
         and "posts"."count_post" = 876)
         and "username" = "mehdi"
```
- The above example as the same code that you use without the eloquent filter. Check it under code.

```php
$user = new User();
$builder = $user->with('posts');
        $builder->whereHas('posts', function ($q) {
            $q->where('count_post', 876);
        })->where('username','mehdi');

```

***Where array the nested relation Model***

You can pass array to make whereIn condition.

```
/users/list?posts[category][]=php&posts[category][]=laravel&posts[category][]=jquery&username=mehdi

select * from "users" where exists 
         (select * from "posts" where 
         "posts"."category" in ('php','laravel','jquery') )
         and "username" = "mehdi"
```

****Special Params****

You can set special params `limit` and `orderBy` in query string for make query by that.
```
/users/list?f_params[limit]=1

SELECT ... WHERE ... order by `id` desc limit 1 offset 0
```
```
/users/list?f_params[orderBy][field]=id&f_params[orderBy][type]=ASC

SELECT ... WHERE ... order by `id` asc
```
```
/users/list?f_params[orderBy][field]=id,count_posts&f_params[orderBy][type]=ASC

SELECT ... WHERE ...  order by `id` asc, `count_posts` asc
```
***Where between***

If you are going to make query whereBetween.You must fill keys `start` and `end` in query string.
you can set it on query string as you know. this params is good fit for filter by date.

```
/users/list?created_at[start]=2016/05/01&created_at[end]=2017/10/01

SELECT ... WHERE ... created_at BETWEEN '2016/05/01' AND '2017/10/01'
```

****Advanced Where****
```
/users/list?count_posts[operator]=>&count_posts[value]=10&username[]=ali&username[]=mehdi&family=ahmadi&created_at[start]=2016/05/01&created_at[end]=2020/10/01
&f_params[orderBy][field]=id&f_params[orderBy][type]=ASC

select * from `users` where `count_posts` > 10 and `username` in ('ali', 'mehdi') and 
`family` = ahmadi and `created_at` between '2016/05/01' and '2020/10/01' order by 'id' asc limit 10 offset 0
```

Just fields of query string be same rows table database in `$whiteListFilter` in your model or declare method in your model as override method.
Override method can be considered custom query filter.

### Custom Query Filter
The Eloquent Filter doesn't support all of the conditions by default. For this situation you can make a override method.
If you are going to make yourself query filter you can do it easily. You just make a trait and use it on model:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

/**
 * Trait usersFilter.
 */
trait usersFilter
{
    /**
     * @param \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder $builder
     * @param                                       $value
     *
     * @return \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder
     */
    public function username_like(Builder $builder, $value)
    {
        return $builder->where('username', 'like', '%'.$value.'%');
    }
}
```

-**Note** that fields of query string be same methods of trait. Use trait in your model:

```
/users/list?username_like=a

select * from `users` where `username` like %a% order by `id` desc limit 10 offset 0
```

```php
class User extends Model
{
    use usersFilter,Filterable;

    protected $table = 'users';
    protected $guarded = [];
    private static $whiteListFilter =[
        'id',
        'username',
        'email',
        'created_at',
        'updated_at',
    ];
    
}
```
-**Note** that fields of query string be same methods of trait. Use trait in your model:

```
/users/list?username_like=a
select * from `users` where `username` like %a% order by `id` desc limit 10 offset 0
```

```php
class User extends Model
{
    use usersFilter,Filterable;

    protected $table = 'users';
    protected $guarded = [];
    private static $whiteListFilter =[
        'id',
        'username',
        'email',
        'created_at',
        'updated_at',
    ];
    
}
```
### Custom Detection Condition

Sometimes you want to make your own custom condition for make new query that eloquent filter doesn't support it by default. Good news you can make
custom condition in the eloquent filter from now on. In fact you can make condition for the generate new query after check by that (New feature :fire: ). For example :

We must make two class first class to detect conditions another class to generate query.
 
- Step 1: Create a class to detect the condition

```php

use eloquentFilter\QueryFilter\Detection\DetectorContract;

/**
 * Class WhereRelationLikeCondition.
 */
class WhereRelationLikeCondition implements DetectorContract
{
    /**
     * @param $field
     * @param $params
     * @param $is_override_method
     *
     * @return string|null
     */
    public static function detect($field, $params, $is_override_method = false): ?string
    {
        if (!empty($params['value']) && !empty($params['limit']) && !empty($params['email'])) {
            $method = WhereRelationLikeConditionQuery::class;
        }

        return $method ?? null;
    }
}
```

- Step 2: After that create a class to generate query. In this example we make `WhereRelationLikeConditionQuery` class:

```php
use eloquentFilter\QueryFilter\Queries\BaseClause;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

/**
 * Class WhereRelationLikeConditionQuery.
 */
class WhereRelationLikeConditionQuery extends BaseClause
{
    /**
     * @param $query
     *
     * @return Builder
     */
    public function apply($query): Builder
    {
        return $query
            ->whereHas('posts', function ($q) {
                $q->where('comment', 'like', "%" . $this->values['like_relation_value'] . "%");
            })
            ->where("$this->filter", '<>', $this->values['value'])
            ->where('email', 'like', "%" . $this->values['email'] . "%")
            ->limit($this->values['limit']);
    }
}
```
- Step 3: You just make the method `EloquentFilterCustomDetection` for return array detections of the condition in the model.

```php
use eloquentFilter\QueryFilter\ModelFilters\Filterable;

class User extends Model
{
    use Filterable;
   
    private static $whiteListFilter =[
        'username',
        'posts.count_post',
        'posts.category',
        'posts.orders.name',
    ];

    /**
     * @return \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\belongsTo
     */
    public function posts()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo('Models\Post');
    }

    public function EloquentFilterCustomDetection(): array
    {
        return [
            WhereRelationLikeCondition::class
        ];
    }

}
``` 

- Every query params are going to detect in `WhereRelationLikeCondition` for the first time after that check by default detection eloquent filter.

Make method `EloquentFilterCustomDetection` in the above example and return array conditions class.

```
/users/list?username[value]=mehdi&username[limit]=10&username[email]=mehdifathi&username[like_relation_value]=mehdi&count_posts=10

select * from "users"
 where exists (select * from "posts" where 
"users"."post_id" = "posts"."id" 
and "comment" like ?) and "username" <> ? and "email" like ? and "count_posts" = ? limit 10
```
You just run code ` User::filter();` for see result.

-**Note** Also you can set custom detection on the fly by use of method `SetCustomDetection`. For example :

```php
$users = User::SetCustomDetection([WhereRelationLikeCondition::class])->filter();
```

-**Note** You can disable `EloquentFilterCustomDetection` on the fly by this code :

```php
 User::SetLoadDefaultDetection(false)->filter();
```

-**Note** You can set many detection conditions for example:

```php

class User extends Model
{
    use Filterable;
    public function EloquentFilterCustomDetection(): array
    {
        return [
            WhereRelationLikeCondition::class,
            WhereRelationLikeVersion2Condition::class,
            WhereRelationLikeVersion3Condition::class,
        ];
    }
}
```

- `EloquentFilter::getInjectedDetections()` get all your custom injected detection.

-**Note** Every custom detection will run before detection by default eloquent filter.

## Configuring

You can generate a config file to configure Eloquent Filter. Has amazing features for your project.

### Publish Config

    php artisan vendor:publish --provider="eloquentFilter\QueryFilter\ServiceProvider"

### Config

- You can disable/enable Eloquent Filter in config file (eloquentFilter.php).


        'enabled' => env('EloquentFilter_ENABLED', true),
    
- Eloquent Filter recognizes every param of query string to pass it. 
Maybe you have a query string that you don't want recognize by Eloquent Filter. You can using of `ignoreRequest` for his purpose.
But we have clean solution to this problem. You can set param request_filter_key in the config file.
Therefore every query string will recognize by request_filter_key param.

    
        'request_filter_key' => '', // filter

For example, if you set `'request_filter_key' => 'filter',` that Eloquent Filter recognizes `filter` query string.

`
/users/list?filter[email]=mehdifathi.developer@gmail.com`


- You can disable/enable custom detection of Eloquent Filter in the config file (eloquentFilter.php).

   
        'enabled_custom_detection' => env('EloquentFilter_Custom_Detection_ENABLED', true),

- You should set index array in ignore_request to ignore by in all filters.


        'ignore_request' => [] //[ 'show_query','new_trend' ],
    

## Magic Methods

Magic methods are a collection of methods that you can use of them as wrapper in the Eloquent Filter.
For example, serialize data before filter or change data in response and others.
Now Eloquent Filter have `serializeRequestFilter`,`ResponseFilter`.

### Request Filter

Eloquent Filter has a magic method for just change requests injected before handling by eloquent filter. This method is 
SerializeRequestFilter. You just implement SerializeRequestFilter method in your Model. For example


```php

class User extends Model
{
    use Filterable;
    public function serializeRequestFilter($request)
    {
       $request['username'] = trim($request['username']);
       return $request;
    }
}
```

As above code you can modify every query params of the Model in the method `serializeRequestFilter` before run by Eloquent Filter. 
This is a good method when you want set user_id or convert date or remove space and others.

### Response Filter

Response Filter is a magic method for just change response after handling by Eloquent Filter. This method is 
`ResponseFilter`. You should implement ResponseFilter method in your Model. For example


```php

class User extends Model
{
    use Filterable;
    public function ResponseFilter($response)
    {
        $data['data'] = $response;
        return $data;
    }
}
```
